Bash scripts and utilities for PostgreSQL

This is my personal repository of general bash utilities.  All of this stuff is distributed under the PostgreSQL license.

These utilities may help you do common tasks in PostgreSQL, or they may just get your cat pregnant.  If you run them without looking, I'm betting on the latter.
